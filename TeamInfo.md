## Project Title
> ICare (Health Management System)
## Project Summary
> In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on personal health and fitness, with many individuals making a concerted effort to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Regular exercise has become a crucial part of daily routines, and people are more mindful than ever about what they consume, paying close attention to the nutritional content of their meals. To cater to this trend, we aim to develop a comprehensive calorie management system that enables users to effortlessly monitor their daily caloric intake. This system will provide an easy-to-use platform for logging meals, snacks, and beverages, offering insights into their nutritional value and helping users make informed decisions about their diet. By offering personalized recommendations and progress tracking, our system will empower users to take control of their health and achieve their fitness goals more effectively. Additionally, we aim to enhance the user experience by offering personalized fitness and meal plan recommendations through an embedded AI API. This AI-driven system will analyze user data, such as fitness goals, dietary preferences, and activity levels, to create tailored workout routines and meal plans.
